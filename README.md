## usage
### Basics of dev containers
### Clone + Rebuild and open
- clone repo
- add .env file with your api keys
### Dev Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume
- will need to add an env file with the api keys, and potentially pip install python-dotenv to load that env file after the container is built.
